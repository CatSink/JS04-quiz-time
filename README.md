# JS04-QUIZ-TIME

## Description

This project is a chance to review JavaScript concepts and apply them to a timed quiz that keeps track of high scores. Although it has been deployed it is still in progress. I am working on a few bugs and need to improve how I define variables and use functions in JavaScript. I have learned a lot about best practices and what not to do throughout the trials of this assignment.
